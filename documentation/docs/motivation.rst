Shoreline evolution models are useful tools in analysing and predicting coastal morphological 
evolution on seasonal to decadal time scales. Several analytic and numerical models have been 
proposed to describe changes in shoreline based on analysis of the balance of sediment volumes 
over a certain time period, assuming an equilibrium beach profile (Pelnard-Considère, 1956; Hanson, 1989; Dabees and Kamphuis, 1998; Steetzel et al., 2000; Coelho et al., 2004).
In platform beaches, due to sediment scarcity, the equilibrium profile assumption is no longer valid so the longshore drift 
estimates must consider the presence of a rocky shore platform and  limited sand availability.  
The Shoreline Evolution Model– SEM, was developed to simulate shoreline changes on coastal stretches 
where continuous or pocket beaches develop over a rocky platform.   

SEM model aims to predict beach development and evolution in headland-bay coasts
and targets the understanding of some key processes such as beach rotation and sediment headland bypassing. 

The present documentation intends to describe SEM model, its fundamentals, calculations procedures and structure, as well its implementation in Phyton and setup.
